Burglary is a major problem in many towns and residential places. This is a situation where thieves break into a store and steal personal property without the consent of the owner. The burglary rate in India jumped by 11.07 % from 7.3 cases per 100,000 population in 2012 to 8.2 cases per 100,000 population in 2013. Since the 3.37 % reduction in 2010, the burglary rate surged by 11.56 % in 2013. And it is keep on increasing...

Presenting you AI-based surveillance system-
It's a natural tendency of a human being that whenever the gun is pointed at the person, he/she will raise their hand in Hands UP!!! position.
Hands Up position will be read by the system along with elbow motion weither it is up or not and wait for the owner to respond. If the owner responds by saying "Don't kill me" or "help me", then a quick message will be sent to telegram group using a telegram bot with a precise location (longitude/latitude). So to make police fetch location easily. As well as it will also activate the alarm system.

We can include local police officer no. as well as our neighbors no. in telegram group...

Our system can also detect the face distance from camera. We can adjust the threshold values where the person is not allowed to come further, as it will detect that he/she is coming to break camera and message will be again sent to telegram group. Every face in the scene is captured and kept in a folder which can then be updated to a database. In the given video, I put 50 cm which can be easily adjusted as per the customer's needs.

I have also developed gun detection (Currently not applied in the prototype). I will soon post about the software modifications and code.

I had been building model over the week and the entire piece needs a lot of modifications to reduce the false positives. If something like this fits into the shops, banks, etc. cameras around the city, I think we will surely get some good days...
